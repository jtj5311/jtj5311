In 1966, V. Arnold established an important connection between the incompressible Euler equations and a particular set of geodesic flows, using variational techniques to characterize the latter as solutions
to the former. Motivated by his results, we investigate a series of similar PDEs characterizing constrained
critical points of action functionals, paying particular interest to those associated with surfactant dynamics. Starting with the Arnold functional, we introduce various complications, adding terms associated to
potential energies, surface tension, and surfactant momentum to derive different PDEs.
