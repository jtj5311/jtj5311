title: "Surfactant Dynamics from the Arnold Perspective"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/paper-1
excerpt: "This paper derives multiple partial differential equations that each 
            govern fluid flow with additional surfactant dynamics. Techniques 
            used include variational calculus."
