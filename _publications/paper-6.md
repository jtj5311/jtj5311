Motivated by a result by G. Schechtman which facilitated the computation of the
p-concavity constant of Banach lattices that are the span of 1-unconditional basic sequences in
Lp([0,1]) for p > 2, we consider a probabilistic generalization which in a specific case would resolve
the 2 < p < 3 case which has been open since Schechtman’s original paper. Our main novel result
is showing that the expected value of the ℓ1/p norm where each element is weighted by a uniform
random on [-1,1] is concave for all p > 2.
