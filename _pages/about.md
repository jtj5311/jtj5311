I'm interested in combining modern computational and machine learning techniques
and mathematics to better handle large systems of data. My current research 
is focused around taking medium to high dimensional data 
generated from dynamical systems that lie on low dimensional (unknown) 
manifolds and trying to numerically reverse engineer the equations 
that governed the original system. In the past I worked on automatically 
compressing neural networks by decomposing them into smaller pieces that 
require fewer parameters and yet still retain the majority of the information
learned by the initial network (i.e., no substantive decrease in accuracy).
Even further in the past I did some research in partial differential equations
on fluid dynamics with additional effects due to soap.
